# ‚úÖ Code Successfully Pushed to GitHub!

Your website is now at: **https://github.com/NCN/ibyftc-site**

---

## Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Do This Now!)

1. Go to your repository: **https://github.com/NCN/ibyftc-site**

2. Click **"Settings"** (top right of the repository page)

3. In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**

4. Under "Source":
   - Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Branch: Select **"main"**
   - Folder: Select **"/ (root)"**
   - Click **"Save"**

5. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to build your site

6. Your site will be live at:
   ```
   https://ncn.github.io/ibyftc-site/
   ```

---

### Step 2: Test Your New Site

Once GitHub Pages is enabled (after Step 1):

1. Visit: **https://ncn.github.io/ibyftc-site/**

2. Check everything works:
   - ‚úÖ Hero image shows on home page
   - ‚úÖ All 7 product images display
   - ‚úÖ All links work (Home, Shop, About, Contact)
   - ‚úÖ Mobile menu works (try on phone)
   - ‚úÖ All Amazon product links work
   - ‚úÖ Responsive design looks good

---

### Step 3: Set Up Custom Domain (imbillingyouforthisconversation.com)

**IMPORTANT**: Only do this AFTER Step 1 & 2 are complete and working!

#### A. Configure GitHub Pages Custom Domain

1. Still in **Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. Under "Custom domain", enter: `imbillingyouforthisconversation.com`
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Wait for DNS check (this will fail at first - that's normal!)
5. Once DNS is verified (after Step B below), check **"Enforce HTTPS"**

#### B. Update DNS Settings (At Your Domain Registrar)

Log into where you bought your domain and update DNS:

**Delete all old WordPress hosting A records first!**

Then add these GitHub Pages A records:

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 185.199.108.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.109.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.110.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.111.153 | 3600 |
| CNAME | www | ncn.github.io | 3600 |

**Wait 10-30 minutes** (can take up to 48 hours) for DNS to propagate.

#### C. Verify Custom Domain Works

1. Go back to GitHub: **Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. Wait for green checkmark next to your domain
3. Check **"Enforce HTTPS"** (very important!)
4. Visit: **https://imbillingyouforthisconversation.com**

---

### Step 4: Final Testing

Once your custom domain is working:

- [ ] Visit https://imbillingyouforthisconversation.com
- [ ] Verify HTTPS (green padlock) is working
- [ ] Test all pages load correctly
- [ ] Click all 7 Amazon product links
- [ ] Test on mobile phone
- [ ] Test contact form (you still need to set up Formspree)
- [ ] Run accessibility check: https://wave.webaim.org/

---

### Step 5: Set Up Contact Form (Optional but Recommended)

The contact form currently doesn't work. To make it functional:

**Option A: Formspree (Recommended - Free Tier)**

1. Go to https://formspree.io and sign up (free)
2. Create a new form
3. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxx`)
4. Edit `contact.html` line 50
5. Replace:
   ```html
   action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"
   ```
   With your actual Formspree endpoint
6. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add contact.html
   git commit -m "Add Formspree contact form endpoint"
   git push
   ```

**Option B: Use Google Forms** (Easier but less professional)
- Create a Google Form
- Embed it in your contact page
- No coding required

---

### Step 6: Cancel WordPress Hosting

**‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY DO THIS AFTER:**
- ‚úÖ GitHub Pages site is live
- ‚úÖ Custom domain is working
- ‚úÖ You've tested everything for at least 7 days
- ‚úÖ All Amazon links work
- ‚úÖ You're 100% confident the new site is perfect

**Then:**
1. Download a final WordPress backup (just in case)
2. Cancel your WordPress hosting subscription
3. Keep your domain registration active!

## Troubleshooting

### Site not showing after enabling GitHub Pages?
- Wait 2-5 minutes and refresh
- Check GitHub Actions tab for build errors
- Make sure branch is "main" and folder is "/ (root)"

### Custom domain not working?
- DNS takes 10-30 minutes (sometimes up to 48 hours)
- Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org/
- Make sure you deleted old WordPress A records
- GitHub's DNS check must show green before HTTPS works

### Images not loading?
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- Verify files are in the images/ folder
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Contact form not working?
- You need to set up Formspree (see Step 5)
- Or use Google Forms as an alternative
